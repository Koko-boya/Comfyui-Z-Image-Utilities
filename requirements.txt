# Base requirements (always needed)
# No additional packages required for basic API functionality

# Optional: For direct local model loading (Z_ImageDirectLocalConfig node)
# Uncomment the lines below to enable direct local model loading:
# torch>=2.0.0
# transformers>=4.30.0
# accelerate>=0.20.0
# bitsandbytes>=0.41.0  # For quantization support
# huggingface-hub>=0.16.0

# Note: If you only use OpenRouter or Local API servers (Ollama, LM Studio, etc.),
# you don't need to install these packages. They are only required for the
# Z_ImageDirectLocalConfig node which loads models directly via transformers.
